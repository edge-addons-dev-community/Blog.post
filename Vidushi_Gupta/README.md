# Make your first utility Edge Add-on
Have you ever surfed a website and were blown away by it's color palette and design? What if I tell you that now you can make your own edge add-on to detect the web page design elements to design and develop your next website/app? You can make this beginner friendly extension in just **7 simple** steps. 

## What is an Edge Add-on? 
> A Microsoft Edge extension is a small program that developers use to add or modify features of Microsoft Edge. An extension improves a user's browsing experience. It usually provides a niche function that is important to a target audience. 

In other words, it is similar to a web application which works with a part or the whole of your browser.
You can refer to the official documentation in the [Microsoft Edge Development docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/getting-started/)

## Let’s get started on building this add-on:
(Please note the word `extension` and `add-on` have been interchangeably used here and mean the same)

We would be building an add-on that detects the font-family that is used on a part of the webpage. In the very same way, you can also detect the font size, line height, font colour and other web design parameters. 

**Step 1:** Create a new directory which will contain the add-on. Let’s name it `Font detection add_on`

**Step 2:** Create a file with the name of [`manifest.json`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/extensions-chromium/getting-started/part1-simple-extension).
The manifest JSON file contains basic platform information like the version of the extension, the permissions, title, icon, etc. This is the blueprint of the add-on. 
```json
{ 
    "manifest_version":2, 
    "name":"Font detection", 
    "version":"1.0", 
    "description":"Detect the fonts used in a webpage", 
    "content_scripts":[ 
    {
        "matches":["<all_urls>"], 
        "css":["popup.css"], 
        "js":["content.js"] 
    } 
     ], 
        "browser_action":{ 
        "default_icon":"icon.png", 
        "default_popup":"popup.html" 
     }, 
        "permissions":["activeTab"] 
}
```
We start off by specifying the `Manifest version` as `2` as the manifest version 1 is depreciated and we use the version 2 currently. Next, we mention the name of our add-on which is “Font-family detection” in our case. With this we specify the version of this extension. We chose version 1 and then we could further move on to version 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, etc. as we progress with newer features. A description of the add-on is provided next. The `content_scripts` tells the add-on where to access the stylesheets (css) and the js files for functionality. Along with this it also specifies the urls that this function should work on – which in our case is `<all_urls>`. The `browser_action` directs the add-on to the default icon and the default html to be rendered on the browser. In the end, we give the extension permissions – which in our case is the `activeTab`. 

*P.S: Make sure you add an image as “icon.png” for the default icon.*

**Step 3:** Creating a default html file – `popup.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html> 

<html lang="en"> 

<head> 

    <meta charset="UTF-8"> 

    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"> 

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 

    <title>Font Family detection</title> 

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="popup.css"> 

</head> 

<body> 

    <button type="button" class="font" id="Family">Font Family</button> 

<script type="text/javascript" src="popup.js"></script> 

</body> 

</html> 
```
In this file we mention the user interface of the extension. In our case we add a button with the name “Font Family” on it. With this we link in the javascript file `popup.js` that tells the function of the add-on. 

**Step 4:** Create the `popup.js` file that mentions the function to be executed by the add-on.

```js
(function user_choice(){ 

    let buttons = document.querySelectorAll('.font') 

    buttons.forEach(item => {item.addEventListener('click', activate);}); 

   

    function activate(event){ 

      let buttons = document.querySelectorAll('.font') 

      let chosenId = event.target.attributes.id.nodeValue; 

      buttons.forEach(item => {item.classList.remove('active');}) 

      document.getElementById(chosenId).classList.add('active'); 

   

      chrome.tabs.query({active: true, currentWindow: true}, function(tabs){ 

        chrome.tabs.sendMessage(tabs[0].id, {userChoice: chosenId}); 

      }) 

    } 

  })();
```
We mention the `user_choice` to be executed on the current window (which is the active tab) in the above function. The code in `popup.js` sends a message to your content script that we create and inject into your browser tab.

**Step 5:** Create a `content.js` file which is the content script for your add-on.

```js
function init(){ 

    createDisplayBox(); 

    browserListeners(); 

  } 

   

  function createDisplayBox(){ 

    let display_box = document.createElement("div"); 

    display_box.setAttribute("id", "extension"); 

    display_box.setAttribute("style", 

    `position: absolute; 

    background-color: #faea00; 

    color: #000000; 

    padding: 10px 15px 10px 15px; 

    border-radius: 5px; 

    font-ramily: Times New Roman; 

    font-size: 15px; 

    width: auto`); 

    document.body.appendChild(display_box); 

  } 

   

  function browserListeners(){ 

    onmousemove = function(event){ 

      var box = document.getElementById("extension"); 

      box.style.left = event.pageX + "px"; 

      box.style.top = event.pageY + "px"; 

    } 

    chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener(function(message){ 

      var choice = message.userChoice; 

      if (choice === "Family"){ 

        onmouseover = function(event){changeText("extension", getCssValue(event, "fontFamily"));} 

     } 

    }) 

  } 

   

  function getCssValue(event, input){ 

    let elementOver = event.target; 

    let text = elementOver.textContent 

    let cssObj = window.getComputedStyle(elementOver); 

    if(text){return cssObj[input];} 

    else{return null} 

  } 

   

  function changeText(id, value){ 

    document.getElementById(String(id)).textContent = value; 

  } 

   

  init(); 
```
In the above code, the function `createDisplayBox` gives the style and user interface of the box that displays the font-family of the letters under/near the cursor. The next functions, look for the `fontFamily` in the css and output it in the display box. 

**Step 6:** Create `popup.css` for the styling of the user interface of `popup.html`

```css
button { 

  background-color: yellow; 

  color: black; 

  font-size: 15px; 

  width: 150px; 

  height: 50px; 

  margin: 5px; 

  font-family: "Times New Roman", Times, serif; 

  border-radius: 10px; 

} 

.active { 

  background-color: green; 

} 

body { 

  background-color: gray; 

} 
```
We add basic styling to the popup’s user interface. You can customize the CSS as per your choice. 

**Step 7:** Loading your extension and testing it.

- Head on to `edge://extensions/` on the edge browser.
- Enable the **Developer Mode**
- Click on **Load unpacked** and select your directory (Font detection add_on). Make sure that the `manifest.json` is in the root of the directory.

- **Reload** your extension after you make any changes to the code and you’re good to go. 
- From the extension panel on the toolbar, select your add-on and *hover* on the webpage to see the font-family.

Voila! And now you have made your first ever utility edge add-on. Go ahead and enhance this extension further by extracting other CSS features of this webpage!

That’s it for this blog. Keep building and hustling✨
